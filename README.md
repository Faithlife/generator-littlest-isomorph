# Littlest-Isomorph Generator

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for littlest-isomorph scaffolding.

## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-littlest-isomorph from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-littlest-isomorph
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
$ yo littlest-isomorph
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).

## What are all these Opinions doing here?

To give a better indication of how its original authors are using
Littlest-Isomorph, some of their common practices are built into this generator:

- BEM
- Express
- LESS
- Normalize.css

That said, they're all added at _this_ level of abstraction, and _none of them
are required to use littlest-isomorph._ Delete at will, and replace with your
own preferences. We sincerely hope there's not enough of that code to make
deleting it more painful than the _documentation_ they provide by existing in
the first place.
